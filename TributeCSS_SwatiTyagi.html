    <p>  <!--Brief description-->
        Sushma Swaraj (14 February was an Indian politician and a Supreme Court lawyer.
        <br> A senior leader of <span>Bharatiya Janata Party </span> , Swaraj served as <span>the Minister of 
        External Affairs of India </span>in the first Narendra Modi government (2014–2019). 
        <br><span>She was the second woman to hold the office, after Indira Gandhi.</span>
        <br>She was elected seven times as a Member of Parliament and three times 
        as a Member of the Legislative Assembly.
        <br> At the age of 25 in 1977, she became the youngest cabinet minister of Indian state of Haryana. 
        <br>She also served as 5th Chief Minister of Delhi for a short duration in 1998 and 
        became the First female Chief Minister of Delhi.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the 2014 Indian general election, she won the Vidisha constituency 
        in Madhya Pradesh for a second term, retaining her seat by a margin of over 400,000 votes. 
        <br>She became the Minister of External Affairs in the union cabinet on 26 May 2014. 
        <br>Swaraj was called <span>"India's best-loved politician" </span>by the US daily Wall Street Journal. 
        <br>She decided not to contest the 2019 Indian general election due to health reasons as 
        she was recovering from a kidney transplant and needed to "save herself from dust and stay safe 
        from infection" and hence did not join the second Modi Ministry in 2019.
        <br>
        <br>
        According to the doctors at AIIMS New Delhi, she succumbed to a cardiac arrest 
        following a heart attack on the night of 6 August 2019. 
        <br>She was awarded <span>the Padma Vibhushan </span>, <span>India's second highest civilan award 
            posthumously</span> in 2020 in the field of Public Affairs.
